Pandoc-math is a tool for converting latex mathematics documents into html. It is a written as
a [Pandoc filter](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) but also has its own command line interface.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is an amazing tool for converting from one markup format into another.
However, when using pandoc for converting latex to html for mathematics documents, there
are a number of issues as pandoc does not provide support for the commonly used
**amsmath** and **amsthm** packages. Pandoc-math seeks to fix these issues when converting latex to html
and provides support for:

 - **Amsthm** theorem environments, styles, qedhere, etc...
 - **Amsmath** commands such as: *\\numberwithin*, *\\eqref*

An example document is shown [here](examples/Example paper/output.html), which is generated by [this](examples/Example paper/main.tex) latex file and the command:

```
pandoc-math main.tex
```

> Note that by simply running pandoc, without the pandoc-math filter, with a command such as `pandoc main.tex -o output2.html -s --mathjax`, we get the document shown [here](examples/Example paper/output2.html).
> This is missing equation numbering, the theorems are numbered incorrectly, and the equation referencing does not work.
